# Watcher of Friends Online

This script lists all user's friends online in VK.com.


# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.


## Example

```bash
python vk_friends_online.py 
Username: 
    user_name
Password: 
    ******
You have 2 friends online:
1. Конифеев Игорь is online
2. Игнашевич Сережа is online
```
